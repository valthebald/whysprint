One of the more daunting things we encounter in open source development is
getting enough people to regularly contribute. To be sustainable, we need to
encourage new contributors to participate. To that end, we seek to engage new
contributors and experienced developers alike to participate in mentoring.
Mentoring provides participants with direction and encouragement to help them
find their way. This session is for anyone who would like to learn more about
the Drupal mentoring program, mentoring in open source in general, how to mentor
new contributors, or how to organize their own sprints. We will cover tools
available to mentors, documentation, and practical techniques for mentoring
newcomers. We will include strategies for how to: * Make sure people feel
welcome * Match tasks to participants * Keep people engaged even when they
struggle * Help without being overbearing * Answer questions even if you do
not know the answer * Enable folks to continue afterward on their own.

        <aside class="notes">
            <p>My name is Valery Lourie, valthebald in all online places you can think of: facebook, twitter, gmail, skype etc.
            <p>Seasoned drupal developer and "backup" sysadmin...
            <br>Started in a "strictly private" company doing Drupal
            <br>Drupal has a active mentoring program that started in... 2011 (https://groups.drupal.org/node/164629)
            <br>A mentor is...
            <br>In the past two years I've become a mentor, learning from other
                experienced mentors. I've also organized a bunch of sprints,
                ranging in size from 5 people to 600 people.
                I here at dev days because I enjoy working in person with people
                I normally only work with in the issue queues and irc,
                to meet new people and be moved by their own drupal stories,
                and to learn.
                Talking with people attending the sprints and the session days
                so far, some of you are here to learn about drupal 8,
                some to sprint, some will benefit when they go home with
                skills and knowledge learned here. Some will go home and
                stir up their local communities with meetups, camps and community
                they grow.
                You might go home and implement one small idea,
                and might help your local community grow.

        <p>expose everyone to bits of the mentoring process:
            <br>mentor in public, in individual issues, in a public channel in irc, or in a room where
            people can overhear interactions between mentors and participants.
            seeing how mentors mentor is like training future mentors,
            <br>anyone who sees how mentors mentor will pick up parts of the mentoring habits.

    <h2>Where do mentors come from?</h2>
    <h3>Engage new contributors and experienced contributors
    <aside class="notes">
        <br>matching tasks, picking simple ones, answering questions we dont know
        and sharing how we find out is how mentors can help bring in people to participate,
        <br>and become repeat participants.
        <br>But where do the mentors come from?
        <br>This is one of the keys to mentoring in public.
        <p>Engage new contributors and experienced contributors
            <br>alike to participate in mentoring</p>
        <br>Experienced contributors will see the mentor interactions
        and reuse those patterns themselves when helping people.
        <br>They can also see what mentors really do, and will see they
        can be a mentor. (Dont have to know answers to all the questions,
        only share how to find answers.)
        <br>Ask in advance for mentors, explain the "qualifications"
        (minimal qualifications and there will be support for mentors).
        Explain the expectations...
        <br>Ask in a pinch. If someone has done a task a few times,
        and a new person wants help doing it, ask that experienced person to help.
        Now they are a mentor.

        <ul>
            <li>document repetitive things mentors explain
            <br>this makes a mentor memory so new mentors know what other mentors have figured out
