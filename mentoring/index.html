<!-- proposal
One of the more daunting things we encounter in open source development is
getting enough people to regularly contribute. To be sustainable, we need to
encourage new contributors to participate. To that end, we seek to engage new
contributors and experienced developers alike to participate in mentoring.
Mentoring provides participants with direction and encouragement to help them
find their way. This session is for anyone who would like to learn more about
the Drupal mentoring program, mentoring in open source in general, how to mentor
new contributors, or how to organize their own sprints. We will cover tools
available to mentors, documentation, and practical techniques for mentoring
newcomers. We will include strategies for how to: * Make sure people feel
welcome * Match tasks to participants * Keep people engaged even when they
struggle * Help without being overbearing * Answer questions even if you do
not know the answer * Enable folks to continue afterward on their own.

        What makes people contribute back?<br/>
        It's rewarding - there are multiple ratings based on contribution to Drupal core and contrib.<br/>
        Drupal.org user profile is a new CV<br/>
        Education - the best way to know how "things" work is to build them<br/>
        Remote work is a big thing in the Drupal community, so gathering together is one of the rare opportunities for social communication in real life (Facebook does not count).

        Last, but not least reason to contribute back to the project - relevance.
	In the world bound by the Drupal development process, you find companies of different size using the same tool set.<br/>
	It's git, it's XDebug, sometimes XHProf, drush... whatever<br/>
	I could be effective on the job market only when I started to contribute, that enforced me to learn tools that are actually required on the job market.<br/>

        <h2>But how do I find one for myself?</h2>
        Go to the issue queue (link in the end of session if you don't know how to find it)<br/>
        Find issues tagged Novice (or Config Novice, or Twig novice), then sort by last changed in reverse order<br/>
        Needs reroll is another good choice for starting<br/>
        Reroll is a process of adjusting patch that was written once, to the changed source code.
	If you are interested in specific subsystem of Drupal 8, you can limit issues to that subsystem.
	Most people don't have preferences, and that's totally fine.
